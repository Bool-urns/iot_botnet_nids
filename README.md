# Botnet Network Intrusion Detection on Resource Constrained Devices for IoT Applications

<b>This is my masters project, which won the PwC Ireland award for M.Sc in Computing (March 2020)</b>
<p>The project explores the idea of network intrusion detection (NIDS) on so-called 'Internet of Things' (IoT) devices, focusing on one of the biggest threats to IoT devices: becoming compromised as part of a Botnet. From examining prior research, it was determined that a lightweight NIDS could be deployed on gateway devices in the IoT architecture. </p>

# IoT-based Network Intrusion Detection

<b>This is my masters project, which won the PwC Ireland award for M.Sc in Computing (March 2020)</b>
<p>The project explores the idea of machine learning-based network intrusion detection (NIDS) on so-called 'Internet of Things' (IoT) devices, focusing on one of the biggest threats to IoT devices: becoming compromised as part of a Botnet.</p>
<p>From examining prior research, it was determined that deploying a lightweight NIDS on gateway devices in the IoT architecture could be a viable solution for preventing egde IoT devices from being compromised as part of a botnet. Over the course of this project, a simple NIDS was created on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and five lightwieght classification algorithms were evaluated for use as part of the system. Each algorithm was trained using simulated botnet attack data, allowing for specific multi-class classification of attack behaviour. The whole system was evaluated in terms of a number of performance metrics and energy consumption (a circuit containing current sensor was created to measure this).</p>
